# Deploying HelpCovid 
## NOTE: This document is still work in progress


### Steps
1. Spin up a virtual machine running Debian
2. Create a `helpcovid`` user and group
3. Create SSL certificate (optional)
4. Adjust Firewall settings
5. Install PostgreSQL
6. Clone `helpcovid`
7. Generate configuration file
8. Run `helpcovid`




## Creating a self-signed certificate

```
sudo apt install openssl
sudo mkdir -p /etc/ssl/localcerts
sudo openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes \
 -out /etc/ssl/localcerts/helpcovid.pem  \
 -keyout /etc/ssl/localcerts/helpcovid.key
sudo chmod 600 /etc/ssl/localcerts/helpcovid*
```

A series of questions will be asked, which would need to be answered. An example
is given below.

```
Output
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:FR
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:Paris
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Bourg Le Reine
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:HelpCovid
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:HelpCovid
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:your_domain_or_server_IP_address
Email Address []:admin@your_domain.com
```


or

```
sudo apt install openssl
sudo apt install ssl-cert
```

The certificate is stored at `/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem` and the
private key at `/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key`.

At any time, the certificate and key may be regenerated by running the following
command: `sudo make-ssl-cert generate-default-snakeoil --force-overwrite`
