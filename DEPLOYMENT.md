# Deploying HelpCovid 
## NOTE: This document is still work in progress


### Steps
1. Spin up a virtual machine running Debian
2. Create a `helpcovid`` user and group
3. Create SSL certificate (optional)
4. Install PostgreSQL
5. Clone `helpcovid`
6. Generate configuration file
7. Run `helpcovid`




## Creating a self-signed certificate

```
sudo apt install openssl
sudo mkdir -p /etc/ssl/localcerts
sudo openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes \
 -out /etc/ssl/localcerts/helpcovid.pem  \
 -keyout /etc/ssl/localcerts/helpcovid.key
sudo chmod 600 /etc/ssl/localcerts/helpcovid*
```

or

```
sudo apt install openssl
sudo apt install ssl-cert
```

The certificate is stored at `/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem` and the
private key at `/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key`.

At any time, the certificate and key may be regenerated by running the following
command: `sudo make-ssl-cert generate-default-snakeoil --force-overwrite`
